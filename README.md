Module 15 Mini-Project: Chat Application Project
Our objective is to create a versatile WebSocket Chat Application, that enables users to communicate in real-time. The system should facilitate a seamless user experience by supporting a wide array of operations, including joining chat rooms, sending messages, and handling users. To achieve this goal, we must implement a diverse set of functionalities using WebSocket technology and JavaScript programming techniques.



Project Requirements
WebSocket Setup and Configuration:
Implement WebSocket connections in the chat application.
Understand the concept of bi-directional, full-duplex communication.
Configure WebSocket server and client to establish communication channels.
Implement Cors Origin to allow communication with front-end applications
Implementing WebSocket Events and Handlers:
Implement connection, message, and disconnection events.
Understand WebSocket event handling and how it differs from traditional HTTP request-response cycles.
Handle WebSocket events to manage user interactions in the chat application.
Creating a Chat Room:
Design and implement a chat room feature where users can join and participate in conversations.
Create join_room.html to create a room and join to enter the chat
Real-Time Messaging and Broadcasting (Optional):
Implement real-time messaging between users in the chat room.
Implement features like message deletion and editing to enhance user experience.
Broadcast messages to all users in the chat room when a new message is sent.
GitHub Repository:
Create a GitHub repository for the project and commit code regularly.
Maintain a clean and interactive README.md file in the GitHub repository, providing clear instructions on how to run the application and explanations of its features.
Include a link to the GitHub repository in the project documentation.
Submission
Upon completing the project, submit your code and video, including all source code files, and the README.md file in your GitHub repository to your instructor or designated platform.
Project Tips
WebSocket Events and Handlers:
Use WebSocket events like onopen, onmessage, and onclose to manage user connections and disconnections.
Chat Room Management:
Create a data structure to store active chat rooms and their participants.
Real-Time Messaging:
Use WebSocket's real-time capabilities to send and receive messages instantly.
GitHub Repository and Version Control:
Repository Management: Establish a GitHub repository for your project and commit code regularly. Utilize version control to keep track of changes and collaborate effectively with team members if applicable.
README.md: Maintain a clean and interactive README.md file in your GitHub repository. Provide clear instructions on how to run the application and explanations of its features. Include a link to your GitHub repository in your project documentation.
